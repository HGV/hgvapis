# HGV APIs

This repository contains the original interface definitions of public HGV APIs that support both REST and gRPC protocols. Reading the original interface definitions can provide a better understanding of HGV APIs and help you to utilize them more efficiently. You can also use these definitions with open source tools to generate client libraries, documentation, and other artifacts.
